## Origins

This AddOn is a fork of the original [Talent Sequence](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/talent-sequence/
) AddOn. With the death of bobos talents, the AddOn became essentially unusable. This fork breaths new life into the AddOn making the following changes:

## How-To


#### *Add Icy Veins Talent Sequence*

* Build your talent sequence in the Icy Veins Cataclysm calculator. Alternatively, use a prebuilt sequence.
   * When using a linked or embedded sequence (eg: the Icy Veins leveling guides), verify that the sequence in the calculator actually includes the talent order. If the calculator was embedded, you should see buttons that allow you to step through the point distribution. This isn't necessary when building the spec yourself as the order is maintained by default. ![talent step buttons](https://i.imgur.com/MT02brt.png)
* Copy the entire Icy Veins talent calcluator URL (NOTE: This is important; instead of special characters for page 3 talents, you should see encoded values like %BE. This will happen automatically if you copy the ENTIRE url)
* In-game, open your Talent window, and click `Talent Sequence &gt;&gt;`
* Click the `Load` button
* Paste the Icy Veins talent calculator URL and load
* Name the sequence and hit enter
* Click the now available button in order to set your talent sequence
* Go level and earn talent points!

## Add WowHead Talent Sequence

* Build your talent sequence in the WowHead Cataclysm calculator. Alternatively, use a prebuilt sequence.
   * Ensure that you have the Talent Order enabled. In the calculator window, you must expand the Talent Order tab and keep it open, or WowHead will not maintain the talent sequence. The import will NOT work if this tab is not open and showing your talent sequence ![wowhead talent calculator screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/LPBe091.png)
* Copy the entire WowHead talent calcluator URL
* In-game, open your Talent window, and click `Talent Sequence &gt;&gt;`
* Click the `Load` button
* Paste the WowHead talent calculator URL and load
* Name the sequence and hit enter
* Click the now available button in order to set your talent sequence
