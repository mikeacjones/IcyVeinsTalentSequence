## What It Is

Talent Sequence 2 is a WoW AddOn for TBC Classic that allows you to display a the talent sequence you've built in various web-based talent calculators side-by-side the in game talent window.

## Supports

* Icy Veins TBC Talent Calculator
* WowHead TBC Talent Calculator
* Hooks into Talented AddOn if you are using it

## Origins

This AddOn is a fork of the original [Talent Sequence](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/talent-sequence/
) AddOn. With the death of bobos talents, the AddOn became essentially unusable. This fork breaths new life into the AddOn making the following changes:

### How-To

#### *Add Icy Veins Talent Sequence*

* Build your talent sequence in the Icy Veins TBC calculator. Alternatively, use a prebuilt sequence.
   * When using a linked or embedded sequence (eg: the Icy Veins leveling guides), verify that the sequence in the calculator actually includes the talent order. If the calculator was embedded, you should see buttons that allow you to step through the point distribution. This isn't necessary when building the spec yourself as the order is maintained by default. ![talent step buttons](https://i.imgur.com/MT02brt.png)

* Name the sequence and hit enter
* Click the now available button in order to set your talent sequence
* Go level and earn talent points!

#### *Add WowHead Talent Sequence*

* Build your talent sequence in the WowHead TBC calculator. Alternatively, use a prebuilt sequence.
   * Ensure that you have the Talent Order enabled. In the calculator window, you must expand the Talent Order tab and keep it open, or WowHead will not maintain the talent sequence. The import will NOT work if this tab is not open and showing your talent sequence ![wowhead talent calculator screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/LPBe091.png)
